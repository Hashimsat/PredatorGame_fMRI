# PredatorGame_fmri
Predator Game adapted for the fMRI, with jitters and ITI scenes.

Have also tried to standardize the time taken for outcome presentation. All outcomes take roughly 2100 ms. (Do empirically check if trial time is almost the same though.)


## Important Scripts:
- Index.html is the main script that runs the game.
- main.js contains all game configurations and sets up the game scenes.


## Things to add:
- Change predator timings.
- Gamma distribution to sample jitters and ITI.
- Timestamps for all important events.
- Something else that I might've forgotten :D.

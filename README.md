# PredatorGame_fmri
Predator Game adapted for the fMRI, with jitters and ITI scenes.

Have also tried to standardize the time taken for outcome presentation. All outcomes take roughly 2100 ms.

- Index.html is the script that runs the game.
- main.js contains all game configurations and sets up the game scenes.
